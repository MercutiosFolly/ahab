# AHAB

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to serve as a place to maintain my more consolidated MKE/MSR/MCR tooling. Items
will be added as I convert my more loosely connected scripts into actual tools consumable by others.

As for the name. I'm hunting whales.

## Tools

#### msr-disk-usage
  This tool is to assist people with analyzing the footprint of the registry images to reduce size and bloat.
  It will be containerized and published to docker hub for ease of consumption by TSEs
